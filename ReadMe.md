#Java #DesignPattern #DAO

This project is an implementation of the Java design pattern DAO. It is developed using NetBeans IDE, MySQL and JDBC. It includes a database that contains the partial list of recipients of The Order Of Ontario. The application can output the contents of the recipients table, insert a new row into the database, delete the row inserted and output the resulting table.
